Documentation under construction!

## Getting Started
- Create `./localdev/data` directory
- Once containers are running, open the Chatterbots Frontend and navigate to Settings. Configure the "OpenAI-Compatible API endpoint" setting. If you are using the provided Docker networking IPAM configuration from `docker-compose.yml`, the host machine can be accessed at `172.33.0.1` (i.e. the "gateway" config key)
